# Semester One - Electrical Engineering Technology (Humber College)

## Overview

Semester 1 was, for me, the most enjoyable and rewarding semester. I deeply appreciated the blend of practical and theoretical aspects in each of the six courses. The hands-on labs and detailed lectures not only enhanced my understanding but also fueled my passion for electrical engineering technology. This immersive experience solidified my commitment to the field and laid a strong foundation for my future studies.

## Courses

### 1. Logic Fundamentals

**Description:**  
The course introduces students to basic digital design, as well as to theoretical and engineering principles used by computers, communications equipment, and control systems. This course offers an opportunity to learn digital logic, including gates, logic functions, relay logic, applications of Boolean algebra, number systems and the application of flow diagrams to logical circuits. The intelligent logic module, LOGO, from Siemens is used to illustrate the logic fundamental concepts and support hands on activities.

**Personal Experience:**  
The hands-on labs were engaging and helped solidify my understanding of digital logic design.

### 2. Introduction to Robotics

**Description:**  
This course covers robotics and industrial automation fundamentals, including system configurations, applications, methods of power transmission, and types of control, tooling and interfacing with peripherals. In addition, there are 'hands on' assignments using industrial robots in the laboratory.

**Personal Experience:**  
Building and programming simple robots was challenging and rewarding, sparking my interest in robotics.

### 3. Electric Circuits

**Description:**  
An introductory course on basic concepts of voltage, current flow and resistance leads to the analysis of series, parallel, and series-parallel circuits. Classical circuit theorems are introduced to calculate the current or voltage in resistive networks. Power and efficiency are studied. Sinusoidal waves and their characteristics are introduced. Capacitors are studied in a simple DC environment. Complementary laboratory work includes the use of multimeters, oscilloscopes, power supplies and signal generators.

**Personal Experience:**  
Hands-on lab sessions were crucial in reinforcing theoretical knowledge.

### 4. Programming Fundamentals

**Description:**  
Students learn to develop logic to write structured programs. Different engineering and technology problems and issues are presented in the course, and the students learn to analyze and develop solutions to these problems. These solutions may then be implemented as applications in structured programming approach. In this course, the basics of programming languages are introduced. The learners will select the appropriate data type to store and process data and will also learn to generate the formatted output display. They learn to design, develop and implement the solutions of the problems based on the conditions and criteria defined in the problem using the control structures, conditional statements and simple arrays. They also learn to use a modular approach of writing structured programs using functions. The main objectives of the course are to introduce the concepts and standards of designing and to implement solutions in a programming language while developing a good programming style and logical and critical thinking. C is introduced as the programming language to develop the applications in this course.

**Personal Experience:**  
This course provided a solid introduction to coding with plenty of practical projects.

### 5. Technical Mathematics 1

**Description:**  
In this introductory course in technical mathematics, the student will demonstrate basic mathematical skills and be able to apply them in specific applications. Topics include numerical computation of basic arithmetic operations, fundamental concepts of algebra and operations, simple equations and formulas, functions and graphs, fractions and fractional equations, ratio proportion and variation, exponents and radicals, exponential and logarithmic functions, angles, right and oblique triangles, trigonometric and sinusoidal functions.

**Personal Experience:**  
The rigorous problem sets helped build a strong mathematical foundation.

### 6. Technical Reading and Writing Skills

**Description:**  
WRIT 120 is designed to develop the reading and writing skills required for clear communication in technical settings. Students will learn to read and write documents that are clear, accurate, grammatically correct, and effective for their audience and purpose. To help students reach these goals, the course covers the following: analytical reading and critical thinking; summarizing and paraphrasing; synthesizing, documenting, and presenting technical information; and the elements of clear writing. The course encourages students to engage critically and authentically with new emerging technologies including AI and algorithms.

**Personal Experience:**  
Improved my ability to communicate technical information effectively through various writing and presentation assignments.
